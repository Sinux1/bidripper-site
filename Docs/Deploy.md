# Setting up for Developers

## Required packages

Some basics just in case (curl and git are the most important)

`sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove && sudo apt install curl gcc make perl git python3-pip -y`  

## Make sure AWS CLI v2 is installed

Navigate to your home directory and install the AWS CLI
```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Configure AWS profile

Have your (secret) access keys ready and then run 

`aws configure`

Follow the questions. When asked enter `us-west-2` for region, and `json` for the question about return data types. This will configure a *_default_* profile that will be used later when pulling the amplify project.  

## Install nvm, npm, and node

From whatever directory  you installed aws cli, run

```bash
curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.0/install.sh" -o install_nvm.sh
bash install_nvm.sh
```

You can close and reopen your terminal like an amateur for this to take effect or run  

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```

Sanity Check
`nvm --version` should return a version number

Set node and npm  

```bash
nvm install v16.13.0
nvm alias default v16.13.0

```
`node -v` and `npm -v` should both return appropriate version numbers.

## Installing AWS Amplify

Create and navigate to the directory you want the bidripper-site loaded into.

`mkdir bidripper && cd bidripper`

Now install the Amplify CLI

`npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`

## Initializing Bidripper From Git Repository

`amplify init --app https://github.com/Sinux1/bidripper-site.git`  

Amplify will clone into the Bidripper repository and initialize the project locally.  
There will be a prompt:
```
? Select the authentication method you want to use: (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ AWS profile 
  AWS access keys 
```

When installing the AWS CLI above, a default profile was made. Select 'AWS Profile', then select 'Default'
